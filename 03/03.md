#03â€”Detect light with the Arduino

__Introduction:__
The purpose of this exercise is to detect and measure light with the Arduino
using a photoresister. A photoresister is just like a resister except that
when you shine a light on it, its resistance will change. Photoresisters
come in several different types. The one that we'll use is a Cadmium-Sulphide
cell or CdS cell.

# Lesson writeup TBD, but here's what we did

1. Hooked up the CdS cell. 10K pull down worked really well.
2. Printed out the values read on the Arduino's analog inputs
   and experimented with covering and shining lights on the
   sensor.
3. Hooked up the Piezo buzzer and made it play a frequency
   corresponding to the light hitting the sensor. Really
   annoying and the buzzers are really bad. Key was to add
   a delay so that playTone wasn't being called continuously.
4. Added an if statement to turn the buzzer on when it was
   too light or too dark. The "too light" version was put in
   a box and when you opened the box up, it beeped at you.
   The "too dark" version was kept on the desk. When you
   waved your hand over it, it would beep at you. Both
   projects ended up being a lot of fun.
