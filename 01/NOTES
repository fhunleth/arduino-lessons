Notes

Some words needed more explanation. Here are a few: IDE, compiler,
resister, configure, LED.

Installation needed help. Getting the serial port to work was
by far the hardest part. Not plugging in the USB cable all the
way could still make the lights go on, but would cause the
Arduino to not enumerate.

The setup and loop functions needed to be explained.

It was a little confusing since the upload process would blink LED 13
before running the program. It was nice to use LED 13, since it just
worked, but it might be worthwhile connecting up an LED first to one
of the other pins.

The circuit diagram picture was good, but the instructions below it 
were easily skipped. This resulted in the LED being placed in
backwards.

The pattern question was confusing. An example would help like make
the LED go on for a second, off for a second, on for 2 seconds, off
for a second and repeat.
